# Consumer Behaviors in A Housing Collapse

Using rich micro retail data and data on household balance sheets between 2007 and 2011, I investigate the retail spending responses of households to the housing bust in the 2000s and early 2010s. The estimated elasticity of consumer spending out of housing wealth is between 0.2 and 0.6. A decrease in retail spending in response to a decline in housing wealth is partly driven by lower retail prices and partly by lower real consumption. One explanation for retailersâ€™ reducing retail prices is that consumers switch to relatively less expensive stores selling the same product given a decline in housing wealth, driving down retail prices in equilibrium and consumer spending. In addition, within a product category, a negative housing wealth shock encourages consumers to purchase less expensive, and potentially lower quality, items.This behavior has important implications for real consumption, and hence consumer welfare.
